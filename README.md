## Credits
_________________________________________________________
### **Please note:** 
* English is not my first language as my first language is ISL (Irish Sign Language).
____________________________________________________________________________________
I learned through the course in Code Institute. I do most learning of different open source on 3WC it helps to remember what the code used tags and style CSS for HTML and CSS, also what I am interested in as scroll smooth, icons, and transitions. I did a few learning to CodePen. 

My mentor had good feedback and helps to my process improvement on site project. 

## Here is my projects: 
________________

### Contents

* I was interested in the active current on the section page. I took the jQuery, it comes from [CodePen.](https://codepen.io/arjunamgain/pen/RwWoQM)  

### Favicon 
* I use of my previous personal website which is now not on the server anymore. I copied the folder to here and replace icon image through photoshop. 

See the image icon on head of the site
![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Icon.png)


### Social media icons

* I took the social media icon from the [3CW school.](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/social-media-logo-collection_3966112.htm#query=social%20media%20icon&position=7&from_view=keyword) 

### Specifies size screen for responsive
* I searched and find the link [Screen size responsive,](https://screensiz.es/monitor) it helps me to know the exact screen size from Desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile devices for the queries media responsiveness.

* I use MacBook pro laptop with a 17” screen and it is very hard to know approx for large desktop screen.

### What I did using queries media list in the CSS.
``` markdown
/*Desktop responsive*/
@media only screen and (max-width: 2070px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
 /* large tablet and small laptop responsive*/
 @media only screen and (max-width: 1354px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
/*tablet responsive from 650px up to 950px) */
 @media only screen and (max-width: 950px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* large mobile, from 450px up to 750px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 750px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* mobile standard responsiveness  for max 450px screen*/
@media only screen and (max-width: 450px)  {…………}
```

``` markdown
 /* small mobile responsiveness  for max 350px screen*/
 @media only screen and (max-width: 350px) {…………}
```

``` markdown
/* smaller mobile  responsiveness */
@media only screen and (max-width: 320px)  {…………}
```

### The dash button icon

* I took an icon dash button from [3WC School.](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_icon_buttons.asp)

### Timeline 

* I did create my own CSS for the timeline history. I had experienced difficulty with a responsive timeline. I decide to copy from [3WC School for the timeline](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_timeline) and I had a few modifications to make the position fit the screen and also responsiveness. The reason is to prevent my time delay. 


### Media

* All the images come from Michael Collins’s Wikimedia and are free to share and link the images and embed a file from Wikimedia. It is in the public domain.

* I like the two images on my site of the project. The mentor pointed out the rights of the images  who are holders' rights. I was concerned about the images, I asked one of the Cohort Facilitators. He instructed me to use a reference and give an example:

``` markdown

e.g. NASA, 2015. NASA astronaut Tim Kopra on Dec. 21 spacewalk [Online]. Washington: NASA. Available from: https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/nasa-astronaut-tim-kopra-on-dec-21-spacewalk [Accessed 7 January 2015].

## Concept Project

Where I did concept project for the Michael Collins' History. The projects follows below:

### Brainstorm 

* The five planes — strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface where I learned [the five planes](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/5-elements-of-ux-design/) and I used the XMind app for project management but I created a mindmap for the project. The brainstorming is very useful therefore it would be running smoothly organised.

### See a screenshot of the mindmap.

 ![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Mindmap-five-planes.png)

 ### Sketch UX

* I was just a quick sketch idea of the site then moved on to Justinmind app.

* See picture below:

![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Sketch.png)

### Wireframe by Justinmind

* I downloaded the Justinmind app for the wireframe I designed a wireframe and learned how use creates a wireframe. It had a lot more work than I expected because I want to create an interactive wireframe mobile. 

* I asked to mentor for advice through chat on Stack. He instructed that just only use design wireframes. I stop to do further what I was trying to create interactive because the time was taking a lot. I moved to start building HTML and CSS.  

### The screenshot desktop and mobile wireframes are here: 

* ### Desktop

![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Accessibility-Contact.png)

* ### Mobile

![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Wireframe-mobile.png)

### Remove the Accessibility Section Page

* I decided to leave out the accessibility page because I was not the able chance to create it. After all, it took a lot of work with CSS and responsiveness. I learned a lot of CSS and I would get better next time. 

* What I did a concept the accessibility to design for focus users who are preferred toggle light/dark mode and for the visually impaired change background to black and foreground yellow for text. Also for text medium to large options to suit the users’ preferences. 

### Research and collection links

#### I did the research for open-source HTML & CSS. I collected links and I wish to keep them for the next time I may able to design for accessibility in the future. 

1)  [Accessibility UX example](https://www.museum.ie/en-ie/accessibility)

1) [Example icon for accessibility](https://castlegarsource.com/news/government-introduces-legislation-build-more-accessible-inclusive-bc)

1) [Dark mode HTML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-dark-mode-for-websites-using-html-css-javascript/amp/)

1) [Choice of Light and dark design](https://www.dreamstime.com/day-night-switch-icon-dark-mode-light-button-mobile-app-interface-design-concept-image184942820) 

1) [For example, click on dark mode](https://redstapler.co/pure-css-minimal-dark-mode-toggle-button/)

1) [Responsive grid use CSS](https://travishorn.com/responsive-grid-in-2-minutes-with-css-grid-layout-4842a41420fe)


### Moodboard 

* The moodboard is an arrangement of images, materials, pieces of text, etc. intended to evoke or project a particular style or concept. It helps to see clearly what you would like to design for the site. I put label images for the timeline, colour pallets, footer, icons accessibility, font of Roboto, light/dark mode, contact, and logo.

* I used the Adobe Illustrator app and create a moodboard. 

See the image below:

![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Moddboard-for-desgin-UX.png)

### Colour Pallet

* I choose the colour pallet because the style is matching to Michael Collins’s history style, green Ireland, soldier uniform and oldest building. It caught my eye with the colour which I found and I like it to match the website. 

1) When I ran the test through the lighthouse and it had issues with contrast colour. 
1)I had to change to get dark from #7a7a76 to #252424 for the button link to external sites. 
1)The footer background get dark from #7a7a76 to #252424.
1) The timeline and museum sections also for the button link to external sites. 
1) The navigation menu bar gets darker from #7a7a76 to #252424 to prevent the match from the footer when you scroll up to menu bar.

### Image colour pallet

* I took the screenshot image to choose the image colour palette from [www.icolorpalette.com](https://icolorpalette.com/imagepalette)

See the image of the colour palette below:

![](assets/images/ReadMe-image/Option%20colours%20to%20be%20decide.png)

### Concluded 

* I completed my concept project for the Michael Collins Legend’s website and included responsiveness. I hope you enjoy my project on the Michael Collins Legend site. The site lives [Michael Collins Legend](https://rqisl.github.io/portfolio-project-1-robert-quinlan/).
