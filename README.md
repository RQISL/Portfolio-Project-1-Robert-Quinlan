 >> The testing has been browsers, are Chrome, Firebox, Safari, Opera and Edge. There are a few problems which are Safari, does not support therefore use “scroll-behaviour: smooth;” in the CSS style. I searched to find what is it problem but it would need to use JavaScript.

>> The testing runs Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Firefox and it does support them. All the screens are fine and responsive but sight little different sizes of aspect screens.
